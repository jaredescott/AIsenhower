# AIsenhower
## Description
This Julia app displays all of a user's incomplete tasks from the AI planning website [Reclaim.ai](https://app.reclaim.ai), organizing them in an urgent-important matrix based on Reclaim's Priorities feature. Tasks with priorities 1-4 are displayed as follows:

  > Priority 1 - Urgent, Important<br>
  > Priority 2 - Not Urgent, but Important<br>
  >  Priority 3 - Urgent, but Not Important<br>
  > Priority 4 - Not Urgent, Not Important<br>

The app allows users to view and interact with their tasks in a succinct visual manner, making it easier to prioritize tasks and plan their day. This is especially useful for users who (like myself) have a large number of tasks on Reclaim and would like to view them all at once in a single window.

## Usage Notes

- Before running the Julia script, obtain an API key from https://app.reclaim.ai/settings/developer and copy it into the `API_KEY` variable at the top of the script. The `DARK_MODE` variable can also be set to `true` or `false` depending on the user's preference.

- Run `julia <path_to_script_directory>/AIsenhower.jl` in the terminal or `include("<path_to_script_directory>/AIsenhower.jl")` in the Julia REPL to start the app. The script will stop running when the GUI window is closed.

- Tasks marked "Up Next" in Reclaim are displayed with a green text color on the matrix.

- Lists of tasks longer than their display box are scrollable.

- Clicking on a task will open the task in the default browser.

- Clicking the refresh symbol () at the bottom right of the app reloads the tasks from the Reclaim API.
